###<h1>Profile</h1>
Data scientist with MSc in Data Science and 5+ years' Experience using Machine Learning algorithms to solve challenging problems. I have a strong background in Exploratory Data Analysis and computer vision. Iâ€™ve been involved in several Machine Learning and Deep Learning competitions. I'm constantly aiming to develop new skills and gain knowledge on more methods of getting insights from Data.
<h1>Competitions</h1>
<h4> Digit Recognizer</h4>
The Digit Recognizer is a kaggle competition using the MNIST dataset to train a simple deep learning model for image recognition. I used the Tensorflow subclassing model to create neural network and obtaining an accuracy of 97% on the test data. The notebook can be found here

<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<h4>Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)</h4>
Using DBSCAN algorithm to target customers with low Credit card activities with a new credit Card APR campaign. in order to make them use the company credit card more often. The jupyter Notebook can be found here.
