<h1>Profile</h1>
Data scientist with MSc in Data Science and 5+ years' Experience using Machine Learning algorithms to solve challenging problems. I have a strong background in Exploratory Data Analysis and computer vision. Iâ€™ve been involved in several Machine Learning and Deep Learning competitions. I'm constantly aiming to develop new skills and gain knowledge on more methods of getting insights from Data.

<h1>Deep learning</h1>
<h2> Fraud Detection with Deep Learning</h2>
I used the credit card Dataset from Kaggle to train a Deep learning model. The dataset has 2 class labels which are valid transaction and Fraudulent transaction. The task is to create a model that can correctly detect a fraudulent transaction. The model I built was able to make prediction on the test dataset to an accuracy of 99.9%

<h2>Inceptionv3 Image Classification</h2>
I used the inceptionV3 Architecture for image classification. The cat vs Dog Dataset was use for training the model. The inceptionv3 model was used as the base model with the layers in it set as trainable.

<h2> Variational Autoencoder</h2>
Creating a varaitional autoencoder model using the model sub classing method in keras. The model is trained using the fashion mnist dataset from tensorflow dataset which contains pictures of shirts and shoes.

<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<h2>Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)</h2>
Using DBSCAN algorithm to target customers with low Credit card activities with a new credit Card APR campaign. in order to make them use the company credit card more often. The jupyter Notebook can be found here.

<h1>Competitions</h1>
<h2> Digit Recognizer</h2>
The Digit Recognizer is a kaggle competition using the MNIST dataset to train a simple deep learning model for image recognition. I used the Tensorflow subclassing model to create neural network and obtaining an accuracy of 97% on the test data. The notebook can be found here
